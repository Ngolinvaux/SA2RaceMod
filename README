  4a. If you are racing and want the same RNG but not know what it is, set 'Set Race Seed' to True and pick a seed number.
  4b. If you want to pick each stage's sets leave "Set Race Seed' false and proceed to pick any set youd like for each stage.
    4b1. Included is the 1024 set numbers [0 will not work, sorry] 
    4b2. Also included is a file of the default sets and some other common sets from previous race mod versions, feel free to add your own notes in there.
5. Enjoy, note sets are only set on stage load so deaths and restarts will not keep your set.
